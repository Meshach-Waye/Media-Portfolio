### Media Portfolio

Welcome! If youâ€™ve found yourself here, it means youâ€™re about to explore a selection of the **incredible work** Iâ€™ve crafted over the past three years in the media industry. Iâ€™m confident that these materials will demonstrate why Iâ€™m the perfect fit for the job. But thatâ€™s just the beginningâ€”while these are only a few examples, my focus is forward-thinking and creating even more **magic** for your company. If you decide to bet on me for this position, youâ€™ll get this level of creativity and much more on a daily basis. 

Inside this folder, youâ€™ll find two Audio Production folders, containing some of my best **promos**, **jingles**, and **segment productions**. Take a moment to listen I'm sure youâ€™ll enjoy them. Youâ€™ll also come across the **Slide folder**, which includes the **content calendar** for *Viva Dishwashing Liquid Soap*. This calendar is packed with strategic plans to elevate the brand's presence. Plus, Iâ€™ve included a **monthly report** on audience engagement and station ratings from various radio stations in Lagos, giving you critical data to make informed, high-impact decisions.

Finally, in the last folder, youâ€™ll discover an interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to provide insightful data in a visually engaging way, offering a seamless experience while unlocking valuable insights.

Iâ€™m excited to share these with you and eager to bring my creative expertise to your team! ðŸš€
